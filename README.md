So how do you write a NSFW code?

Here's how:

### 1. Getting Started
Every program starts with ```lauda start```. All the code examples are included within ```lauda start ... lauda end```
An error in this language means ```LundLock: Maa chudd gyi at Bed 4```. The bed here symbolizes the line number.
### 2. Declaring variables of type integer
So you can just do that now apart from comments. The way of doing it is by saying: ```lauda yeh hai var_name = var_value```
### 3. Comments
To add comments, just simply write ```cum this is a comment```
### 4. Printing things to console
Heh, easy man! You can do this by running ```gawk(x+y)```
